## About

EcoTogether attempts to address the issue of environmental sustainability through human responsibility. It provides users a social platform where they are able to share resources in order to enact change in their community, and features a tool that helps users find eco-friendly alternatives to commercial products. Through EcoTogether, we aim to bring people together in the environmental movement, and instill hope that it is never too late to save our planet.

## Inspiration
Environmental sustainability has become increasingly difficult to achieve in the modern world due to factors such as exponential growth in population, consumerism, and the need for natural resources (overexploitation). Through these detrimental effects, our planet has fallen victim to unprecedented changes, including habitat loss, degradation, and climate change. 

EcoTogether attempts to address the issue of environmental sustainability through human responsibility. It provides users a social platform where they are able to share resources in order to enact change in their community, and features a tool that helps users find eco-friendly alternatives to commercial products. Through EcoTogether, we aim to bring people **together** in the environmental movement, and instill hope that it is never too late to save our planet.

## ⚙ What it does
Our project, EcoTogether, is made up of three main components:
1. **Home:** A little introduction on the problem we are trying to solve, our goal/aim, and our roles within this project. 
2. **Social:** Users can share their contribution to environmental preservation with others. ]They can post upcoming campaigns and events and can collaborate with each other.
3. **Campaigns/Events:**  They also have the ability to start campaigns and events. Other users can join these campaigns by donating in order to support the specified cause or meeting up at scheduled clean up sites. As for events, users are able to organize hackathons, seminars, and contests to spread environmental awareness. 
4. **Eco-finder**: This page helps users to find eco-friendly products instead of commercial ones. For example, if the user wants to find a toothbrush, then it will give search results of environment friendly toothbrush substitutes. 

## 🛠How we built it
- **Frontend:** We built out frontend on the _ReactJS_ library and used _styled-components_ for styling and smooth animations. We also used some _ready-built components_ from the _Material UI_ library. In addition to this, _react-toastify_ was used for error handling and _Axios_ was used for handling HTTP requests. We also used a Google Search API for our EcoFinder section.
- **Backend:** Our backend was built on _Node.js_. We used _Express.js_, which is a _Node.js_ framework, for middleware features. We used _MongoDB_ as our database and _mongoose_ as an ORM. _Socket.io_ was also used to implement the bidirectional data transfer in the chat box inside the campaign section. 

## 🚀What's next for EcoTogether
- Improving the UI
- Adding fully functional features like donations, group chats in the Campaign Section, so that people joining a campaign can interact in the application only and can support the event by donating.
- Incorporate ML to help users to quickly find eco-friendly products

## Key Features

- A post page where users can share their contribution to environmental preservation with others
- An Events/Campaigns Page where users can host a campaign or an event to make people aware about environment preservation.
- "Eco-finder," a tool that helps users find eco-friendly alternatives to commercial products.
