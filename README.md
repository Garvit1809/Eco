## About

EcoTogether attempts to address the issue of environmental sustainability through human responsibility. It provides users a social platform where they are able to share resources in order to enact change in their community, and features a tool that helps users find eco-friendly alternatives to commercial products. Through EcoTogether, we aim to bring people together in the environmental movement, and instill hope that it is never too late to save our planet.

## Key Features

- A post page where users can share their contribution to environmental preservation with others
- An Events/Campaigns Page where users can host a campaign or an event to make people aware about environment preservation.
- "Eco-finder," a tool that helps users find eco-friendly alternatives to commercial products.
